Welcome to 3pseatBot's documentation!
=====================================

3pseatBot started as a bot that enforced the arbitrary rule on a Discord server that all messages start with "3pseat".
3pseatBot has since developed into a multipurpose bot with useful features and not-so-useful features.
3pseatBot includes a number of cogs (extensions) that extend the base functionality of a bot and support for adding your own cogs.
